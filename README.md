# CryptoTrio
This project demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental cryptographic algorithms—RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), and Diffie-Hellman (DH)—from scratch. The goal was to explore the core principles of public-key cryptography and secure communication by creating these algorithms without relying on pre-built cryptographic libraries.
